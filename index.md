Nonprofits have many challenges.  My goal is to help you use your resources in the best way possible to achieve your mission.  

Whether you are…

<p class="pad-sides">…A social service agency wanting to make sure that you can help your clients both effectively and efficiently – through planning, financial management or taking your organization to the next level,</p>

<p class="pad-sides">…A foundation looking to ensure that your funds are used most wisely to support the nonprofits in your community or that your grantees are getting the assistance they need to be most successful,</p>

<p class="pad-sides">…A CDFI needing assistance in underwriting, portfolio management or monitoring to ensure that your investments are lent wisely,</p>

<p class="lead">I can help!</p>
