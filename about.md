Nonprofit consultants can play many roles.  Claireâ€™s years of working for nonprofits both as an employee and as a consultant gives her an ability to:

* Bring a specific expertise not available on your staff or board such as the ability to do business or strategic planning and loan underwriting.

* Act as an extension of staff for special projects or additional capacity including conducting program research, creating financial projections or business plans, assessing grant applications and portfolio strength.

* Gather a variety of types of information from an outside and impartial perspective.

* Be there as an advisor/coach/sounding board to provide feedback and perspective.

### Bio

Claire Morduch brings a wealth of experience consulting to a variety of nonprofit organizations from across a range of sectors.  She uses a combination of process and quantitative skills to collect and distill large amounts of information from a variety of perspectives, and provides a meaningful and useable analysis.   Her goal is to help nonprofits create more effective and efficient organizations that are better able to meet their mission and is as much at home with financial and impact analysis as with issues of planning, organizational culture, leadership and management systems. Claire is particularly attentive to the kinds of information, processes and support that different types of groups need to function effectively.  

Claire works with:

* Start-ups setting up infrastructure, financial systems, and financial projections; 

* Established nonprofits conducting strategic and business planning, including financial 
projections for growth, program research, analysis and evaluation; 

* Financial intermediaries providing loan underwriting, portfolio analysis and planning; and 

* Foundations conducting grant reviews, program research and analysis.  

Claire returned to nonprofit consulting after four and one-half years as Director of Finance and 
Administration at Connecticut Voices for Children.  Prior to that she was with BWB Solutions for 
over fifteen years, most recently as Associate Partner.  When Claire initially turned to consulting 
after 10 years of management in nonprofit and both traditional and worker-owned for for-profit 
settings, it was to help make progressive social change organizations more effective.
