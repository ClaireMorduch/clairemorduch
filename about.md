Nonprofit consultants can play many roles.  Claireâ€™s years of working in different capacities for nonprofits -- as an employee, board member, volunteer and consultant -- gives her an ability to:

* Bring a specific expertise not available on your staff or board such as the ability to do business or strategic planning and loan underwriting.

* Act as an extension of staff for special projects or additional capacity including conducting program research, creating financial projections or business plans, assessing grant applications and portfolio strength.

* Gather a variety of types of information from an outside and impartial perspective.

* Be there as an advisor/coach/sounding board to provide feedback and perspective.


"Many thanks, Claire, for everything... on a personal and professional level you helped me gain a confidence that goes far beyond any dollar amount... thank you for the empowerment."  --Amanda
