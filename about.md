Nonprofit consultants can play many roles.  Claireâ€™s years of working in different capacities for nonprofits -- as an employee, board member, volunteer and consultant -- gives her an ability to:

* Bring a specific expertise not available on your staff or board such as the ability to do business or strategic planning and loan underwriting.

* Act as an extension of staff for special projects or additional capacity including conducting program research, creating financial projections or business plans, assessing grant applications and portfolio strength.

*"Thank you so much! You did a wonderful job describing and emphasizing the importance of our project. We have received word that we are being awarded a grant.  We have no doubt that your thoughtful probing and clarification of details in our meetings and emails provided the necessary input the grant committee needed. We are grateful to you for all that you did to help our organization and our future clients." --Cindy*

* Gather a variety of types of information from an outside and impartial perspective.

* Be there as an advisor/coach/sounding board to provide feedback and perspective.


*"Many thanks, Claire, for everything... on a personal and professional level you helped me gain a confidence that goes far beyond any dollar amount... thank you for the empowerment."  --Amanda*
